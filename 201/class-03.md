## Read3 summary : 

Html provides 3 ways to do list : ordered list <ol>, unordered list <ul>, and Definition lists <dl>. Also we can do nested listes.

CSS handle HTML page as if it is a combine of boxes. So added background color,indicates the height and wedith by CSS is possiple. Also, we can display the border or make it hidden.

border, margin, and padding are imprtant commands that use to indicate the distances and control it.

The padding and margin properties are very helpful in adding spacebetween various items on the page.

it is possiple to control the position of boxes and make it vertical or horizantal by dispaly. 

by using CSS3 we can add border to images and ae can crear rounded border. 

Arrays are different way to declear a variable. it uses when we have different values related to each other or when we maent to creat a lists. it is  especially helpful
when we don't know how many items a list will contain.

To creat array we use var nameOfArray and we put the values in square braces and separate them by comma and Each item in an array is automatically given a number called an index.Example:
var colors;
colors ['white', 'black', ' custom ']; ,

we can change the values inside the array.

Switch statment is a condition statment starts with avariable called the switch value Each case indicates a possible value for this variable and the code that should run if the variable matches that value and if none of the cases match default option will run.

in JS code we can convert the datatype of the variable or the value.

There is a diffrent between null and undefined value , null is empty value and undefined display because of variable has been declared without assigned a value.

there are 3 types of loops , for, while and do while. It check the condition , if it's true it run the code that inside the {} and reapeats untile the condition value is false.

Important keyword in loops: break it will stop the run of current iteration and go to the next step , continue will make it continue with the current iteration and then check.

If the condition never returns false that will cause infinite loop.
