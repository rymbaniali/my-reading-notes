in HTML we use <form> to take data from the visitors, There are several types of form controls that we can use to collect information from them to your site such as adding text, making choices, submeter forms and uploading files.

A form may have several form controls, each gathering different information. The server needs to know which piece of inputted data corresponds with which form element.

Forms can be sent using one of two methods: 
1.get:is ideal for short forms.
2.post:is ideal long forms 

The <input> element is used to create several different form controls. The value of the type attribute determines what kind of input they will be creating.

there are many types of input that we can use like password, user name, text ... . 

Each form control is given a name, and the text the user types in or the values of the options they select are sent to the server.

HTML5 introduces new form elements which make it easier for visitors to fill in forms.




The list-style-type property allows you to control the shape or style of a bullet point and known as a marker.
 
If you have empty cells in your table, then you can use the empty-cells property to specify whether or not their borders should be shown and It can take one of three values inherit, show ,and hide.

Table cells can have different borders and spacing indifferent browsers, but there are properties you can use to control them and make them more consistent.

The border-spacing property allows you to control the distance between adjacent cells.

the event is the way that the website can interact with the visitor and it have  many types to handle the event, 

When the user interacts with the HTML on a web page, there are three steps involved in getting it to trigger some JavaScript code. Together these steps are known as event handling.

Binding is the process of stating which event you are waiting to happen, and which element you are waiting for that event to happen upon. 

The most commonly used events are W3C DOM events, although there are others in the HTMLS specification as well as browser-specific events.
