the design should be able to work on a range of different sized screens, and because of screen sizes and display resolutions vary , web designers often try to create pages of around 960-1000 pixels wide.

<div> elements are often used as containing elements to group together sections of a page.

The float property moves content to the left or right of the page and can be used to create multi column layouts.
