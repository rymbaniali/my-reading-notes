Html page is the structure of my web .

it contain semantic tags to make the code readable and to give more importance to the text but it sometimes won't change the text.
also it has Structural tags which used to describe the pragraph and heading.

there are many tags in html that we can use to make change or to givr the importance to the text suh as: 
<h1><lh1>, <sub></sub>, <sup></sup>,<ins></ins>,<s></s>,..... .

if we want to make horizantal rule we can use <hr />, and < br /> to make vertical line (to start the text in new line).

we use CSS to style the web  and make it more attractive.
we can change the text color and it is possition, Also we can change backgroundcolors and we can add many details that make the website much interest and unique.

A CSS rule contains two parts the selector and thea declaration,for example :
P { text-align:center;} == p is the selector part and { text-align:center;} is the decleration.
Also the decleration separets into two parts: the property and the value, for exaple: 
color:red; ==color is the property and red is the value. It is poosible to specify
several properties in one declaration but it has to be separated by a semi-colon.
 
we can write CSS code in three ways :
1.inline:inside the opening tag.
2.intrnal: write the CSS code inside html file by adding <style> tag.
3.external: Creat CSS file wwith extension .css and use self closing tag <link> to connect it with the html file.

CSS take the last chang _last rule _ on the elemnt.


when you write JS code you write the script which is like instruction that the computer will flow one by one and each instruction known as statment.

JS differ between the text , numbers and true or false value and it is called DataType. 
text is a string, and T or F valus called boolean. and should declear variable to store in it. 

we can use var, let,const and array to declear variables.

In partical step in the code the computer must have a dessicion ; which statment will run, 
so it has conditions - that use comparison and logical expression- and depend on it the computer will decied. to make that possiple we use if statment and loops.
