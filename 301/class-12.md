1.write five differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:
	-SQL databases are primarily called as Relational Databases (RDBMS); whereas NoSQL database are primarily called as non-relational or distributed database.
	-SQL databases are table based databases whereas NoSQL databases are document based, key-value pairs, graph databases or wide-column stores.
	-SQL databases have predefined schema whereas NoSQL databases have dynamic schema for unstructured data.
	-SQL databases are vertically scalable whereas the NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable. 
	-SQL databases uses SQL ( structured query language ) for defining and manipulating the data, which is very powerful. In NoSQL database, queries are focused on collection of documents. Sometimes it is also called as UnQL (Unstructured Query Language).
 	  	 
 	 
2.What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?
	 -Table based databases

3.What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?
	-NoSQL databases are document based

4.Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?
	NOSQL

5.Which type of database is best for scalability?
	-SQL databases.

6.What does SQL stand for?
	-Structured Query Language.

7.What is a realational database?
	-Database which works with certain assumptions or in a certain way.

8.What type of structure does a relational database work with?
	-SQ language the structured query language

9.What is a ‘schema’?
	-Fields in the table contain datas.

10.What is a NoSQL database?
	-an approach to database design that provides flexible schemas for the storage and retrieval of data beyond the traditional table structures.

11.What is inside of a Mongo database?
	-MongoDB stores data records as documents which are gathered together in collections. A database stores one or more collections of documents.

12.Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.
	-MongoDB, some research has shown that the speed of MongoDB could be 100x faster than a relational database, and it has easy setup.

13.What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?
	-don't have the reliability functions.
