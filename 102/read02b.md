Git is a DVCS that stores data in a file system made up of snapshots and mostly relies on local operations. the main idea of it is to minimize the irreversible damage that could happen to files.
Three main states of git files: committed, modified, and staged. 
Git config tool allows the setting of configuration variables that control aspects of Gitâ€™s operation and look.
To check settings, use the git config --list command.

there are three ways to ask about a particular command:
1.git help command
2.git command --help
3.man git-command


The local Git repository has three components: Working Directory, Index, and Head.
