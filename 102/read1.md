 1. code completion.
 2.syntax highlighting.
 3.a nice variety of themes (to reduce eye strain andfatigue).
 
the ability to choose from a healthy selection of extensions available when you need them.
The shorthand language called" Emmet" can help speed up code writing, Some text editors come with Emmet built right in, or Emmet can be added by the means of an extension.
More extensions in the text editor mean more ability to add functionality as you need it.
Every computer will come with its own text editor, On Mac computers called “Text Edit.” On Windows computers called “Notepad.”, on Linux computers, each distribution will have its own text editor but they won't assist in finding mistakes. also, there is no syntax highlighting, no themes, and no extensions. there is no syntax highlighting, no themes, and no extensions.
The main HTML file should be called, “index.html.” and the CSS file should be called  “style.css.” The filename isn’t as important as the extension ( “.html” and “.css”).
There are many text editors to choose from. some of it free and some are not. Every developer should go with the most enjoyable text editor for him/her.
An IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is really a suite of different software all coming together. IDE is an all-in-one software package. it is very much like Microsoft Outlook.
