 2.syntax highlighting.
3.a nice variety of themes (to reduce eye strain and
fatigue).
 4.the ability to choose from a healthy selection of extensions available when you need them.

The shorthand language called" Emmet" can help speed up code writing, Some text editors come with Emmet built right in, or Emmet can be added by the means of an extension.
More extensions in the text editor mean more ability to add functionality as you need it.
Every computer will come with its own text editor, On Mac computers called “Text Edit.” On Windows computers called “Notepad.”, on Linux computers, each distribution will have its own text editor but they won't assist in finding mistakes. also, there is no syntax highlighting, no themes, and no extensions. there is no syntax highlighting, no themes, and no extensions.

HTML is tags language; there are two types of them: the self-closing tag and the tag with the open and closing symbol.
we can create a title, paragraphs, tables, add images, audio or videos and, many other options. Also, we can add links and connect pages together.
CSS is to style the page, either write CSS code in the HTML file or link a CSS file with the HTML file.

We can create web pages with HTML and CSS. HTML is to build the structure and CSS controls the design and makes it more interesting.

-HTML5 introduces new form elements which make it easier for visitors to fill in forms.
-we use the <meta> element to add information about the web page. we write it inside the <head> section and <embed> uses to embed pages, videos, extra links, within my page.

-There are different versions of HTML language such as XHTML 1.0, HTML 4, and HTML5 which is the latest update. Each web page should begin with a doctype declaration to tell the browser which version of HTML the page is using. 
-Although HTML5 and CSS3 are already widely being used by web developers their usage is still subject to change.

-To add a comment in HTML code (which makes it much easier to understand) we can use the <!-- --> tag.
-ID Attribute used to uniquely identify that element from other elements on the page.
- The class attribute used to uniquely identify several elements as being different from the other elements on the page.
- The <div> and <span> elements allow you to group block-level and inline elements together.
- <iframes> cut windows into your web pages through which other pages can be displayed.

It is important to organize the web page so the visitors can find the information in an easy way, Also it is better to know the target audience -their ages, sex, country, level of education,  and interests- to make it more suitable for them.

To determine why people are coming to your website, there are two basic categories of questions that can help; the first is why visitors come to the site? what is their motivation? and the second examines the specific goals of the visitors.

Site maps can be used to help you decide what information should go on each page; a card sorting technique can be useful for this.
 Wireframes allow to organize of the information on each page.

In order to make good navigations, you should be Concise, clear, Context, Interactive, consistent, and selective.

loops is a checked condition, it run the statements inside the loop till the value of it is false.

There are 3 types of the loop:
- for the common one, used when we want to run the code specific numbers of times that we want to run the code. the condition is usually a counter.
- while: used when we don't know the number of times that we want to run the code. the condition can be something else than the counter. run as long as the condition is true.
- do-while: same as while, the difference is it will always run the statement inside the curly braces even if the condition is false.

-- for (condition == "i< no." ) {  } 
The loop starts with the for word, then contains the condition inside the parentheses. As long as the counter is less than the total number of items in the array, the contents of the curly braces will continue to run. Each time the loop runs, the round number is increased.

-- while (condition ) {}
The loop starts with the while word, then contains the condition inside the parentheses. As long as the value of the condition is true, the contents of the curly braces will continue to run.

A for loop is often used to loop through the items in an array.

In CSS we can specify the color in three different ways : by RGB values, hex codes and color names. 


Ex: 
color name:
h1 {color: DarkCyan;}

 hex code:
h2 {color: #ee3e80;}

rgb value:
p {color: rgb(100,100,90);}


Every color on a computer screen is created by mixing amounts of red, 
green, and blue.

Values for red, green, and blue are expressed as numbers between 0 and 255.

-- Hue:near to the colloquial idea of color.
-- Saturation:  refers to the amount of gray in a color.
-- Brightness: refers to how much black is in a color


-- Difference between brightness and lightness: 
brightness only adds black, whereas lightness offers both white and black. 

-- Margin property: used to decrease the gap between the elements.
-- Padding to create a gap between the elements. 


 It is important to ensure that there is enough contrast between any text and the background color.

CSS3 added new ways to pick colors such HSL and hsla, also added opacity property.
