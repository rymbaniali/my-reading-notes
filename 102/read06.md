In CSS we can specify the color in three different ways : by RGB values, hex codes and color names. 


Ex: 
color name:
h1 {color: DarkCyan;}

 hex code:
h2 {color: #ee3e80;}

rgb value:
p {color: rgb(100,100,90);}


Every color on a computer screen is created by mixing amounts of red, 
green, and blue.

Values for red, green, and blue are expressed as numbers between 0 and 255.

-- Hue:near to the colloquial idea of color.
-- Saturation:  refers to the amount of gray in a color.
-- Brightness: refers to how much black is in a color


-- Difference between brightness and lightness: 
brightness only adds black, whereas lightness offers both white and black. 

-- Margin property: used to decrease the gap between the elements.
-- Padding to create a gap between the elements. 


 It is important to ensure that there is enough contrast between any text and the background color.

CSS3 added new ways to pick colors such HSL and hsla, also added opacity property.
