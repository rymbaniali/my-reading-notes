-HTML5 introduces new form elements which make it easier for visitors to fill in forms.
-we use the <meta> element to add information about the web page. we write it inside the <head> section and <embed> uses to embed pages, videos, extra links, within my page.

-There are different versions of HTML language such as XHTML 1.0, HTML 4, and HTML5 which is the latest update. Each web page should begin with a doctype declaration to tell the browser which version of HTML the page is using. 
-Although HTML5 and CSS3 are already widely being used by web developers their usage is still subject to change.

It is important to organize the web page so the visitors can find the information in an easy way, Also it is better to know the target audience -their ages, sex, country, level of education,  and interests- to make it more suitable for them.

To determine why people are coming to your website, there are two basic categories of questions that can help; the first is why visitors come to the site? what is their motivation? and the second examines the specific goals of the visitors.

Site maps can be used to help you decide what information should go on each page; a card sorting technique can be useful for this.
 Wireframes allow to organize of the information on each page.
