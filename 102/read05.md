## Read05 summary : 

loops is a checked condition, it run the statements inside the loop till the value of it is false.

There are 3 types of the loop:
- for the common one, used when we want to run the code specific numbers of times that we want to run the code. the condition is usually a counter.
- while: used when we don't know the number of times that we want to run the code. the condition can be something else than the counter. run as long as the condition is true.
- do-while: same as while, the difference is it will always run the statement inside the curly braces even if the condition is false.

-- for (condition == "i< no." ) {  } 
The loop starts with the for word, then contains the condition inside the parentheses. As long as the counter is less than the total number of items in the array, the contents of the curly braces will continue to run. Each time the loop runs, the round number is increased.

-- while (condition ) {}
The loop starts with the while word, then contains the condition inside the parentheses. As long as the value of the condition is true, the contents of the curly braces will continue to run.

A for loop is often used to loop through the items in an array.
